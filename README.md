• **Objective:** Tasked with determining the market price of houses for a real estate investment trust, focusing on leveraging residential real estate data. The goal was to analyze and predict housing prices using various features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of floors.

• **Approach:** Conducted an in-depth data analysis to understand the correlation between house prices and their features. Implemented data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns to refine the dataset for accurate predictions.

• **Techniques:**
  - Employed statistical methods to summarize the dataset, providing insights into the distribution and correlation of features.
  - Trained multiple linear regression, multiple linear regression with polynomial features, and ridge regression models.
  - Conducted a grid search to find the best parameters for the degree of the polynomial features used and the value of regularization parameter alpha in ridge regression.
  - Replaced missing values with the mean of their respective columns to maintain data integrity and ensure robust model training.
  - Utilized the correlation matrix to identify features most strongly associated with house prices, aiding in feature selection for predictive modeling.
